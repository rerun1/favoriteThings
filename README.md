#### Forms with Scripts to Create Arrays from User Input
#### _**by Suzi Rubino â€” August 9th, 2019**_
<br>

## Description
A page with a form containing input fields where users may enter several of their favorite things. Code gathers each of these form input values and places them into one array. It practiced targeting and moving elements between arrays:
- Use square bracket notation to access the second, first, and third elements of the original array of favorite things.
- Push() to add only these elements to a brand new array.
- Displays new array in page's HTML as list items in a <ul> tag.

## Objectives
- [X] JavaScript business logic and user interface logic are separate.
- [X] Variable names are descriptive and use lower camel case (e.g. myVariableExample).
- [X] Code is clean, well-refactored, and easy-to-read. This includes correct indendation, spacing, and including only necessary comments and debugging tools.
- [ ] Application implements a for loop and works as expected.
All previous objectives have been met.
- [ ] Project is broken down into "plain English" specs, listed in README.
- [X] Project is in a presentable, portfolio-quality state.
- [x] Practice styling with imagery and fonts
