# Favorite Things
#### Forms to Create Arrays
#### _**by Suzi Rubino â€” August 8st, 2019**_
<br>

## Description
A page with a form containing input fields where users may enter several of their favorite things. Code gathers each of these form input values and places them into one array. It practiced targeting and moving elements between arrays:
- Use square bracket notation to access the second, first, and third elements of the original array of favorite things.
- Push() to add only these elements to a brand new array.
- Displays new array in page's HTML as list items in a <ul> tag.
